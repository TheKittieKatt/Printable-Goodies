Tool Head & Extruder Stands

I made these stands to make photographing and storing the tool heads and extruders used in the testing done for this repo easier.    

They each take 4 standard m3 heat sets.  

Your tool head mounts to this just like it would to a MGN12 rail.   

As for the extruder mounts the hole spacing should match standard g2ww spacing.   All variations of g2 extruders to date (Mar 13, 2025) will work on these, including the AntHead variant that has the mounting bit at the bottom.  

I have been printing them at 20% infill and 4 perimeters out of PLA with no issues.
