RackRoller Filament Roller Spacer

This is a spacer that goes in the middle of a set of rollers for RepRacks that uses bearings to allow spools to spin smoothly.  I love these rollers, but was not a fan of the spacers provided so I made these.  These also allow this to be used standalone not just on a RepRack.

These spacers work with most plastic spools.   I can confirm works with Cookie Cad, Sparta3D, Sunlu, and a few others.
